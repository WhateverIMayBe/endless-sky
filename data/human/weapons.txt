	description "Energy blaster has the reputation of energy efficient, reasonably accurate but doubtlessly obsolete weapon of the ages past. In spite of this, the Energy Blaster is popular among merchants because it is small enough to be installed on even the tiniest of ships, and it has negligible power consumption. And while one blaster is not enough to do appreciable damage to anything larger than a fighter, a ship equipped with several of them becomes a force to be reckoned with."

	description "A Blaster Turret is a pair of Energy Blasters mounted on a rotating platform, allowing it to fire in any direction. Sophisticated software algorithms allow the turret to correct for a target's motion, making the Blaster Turret effective against small targets. Because it needs a special mounting point with a 360 degree field of view, not all ships are capable of being equipped with a turret."

	description "Modified Blaster has been tampered with to use over three times more energy, increasing power of the blasts as well as its rate of fire. While its power is rather impressive, it's extreme inaccuracy makes it weapon of limited popularity. Modified Blasters also produce an extreme amount of heat when firing, running the risk that your ship will overheat. "

	description "The Heavy Laser is an upgraded Beam Laser with a significantly longer range and higher power.

Unlike conventional anti missile systems created solely to protect the ship they're mounted on, the Fleet Anti Missile aims to provide dedicated anti missile ships with the ability to provide wide-area missile denial for a larger fleet. While it is a potent tool for any patrol group, its abysmally low rate of fire and considerable bulk make it unsuitable for single-ship use."

While capable of a high fire rate, this gun needs to cool down for twice as long as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`
