	description "Developed as a fighter weapon, the pulse laser is a short burst, energy consuming weapon derived from the Deep's beam laser. Its high energy consumption necessitates for a battery module to be installed along with it. While very popular among carrier commanders, its short range makes it much less so popular with the fighter pilots themselves."
